# Installing cp-clip on MacOS

1. Install .dmg file like any other .dmg. So drag cp-clip icon into Applications folder.
2. Go to your Applications folder.
3. Try running cp-clip once.
4. You will get this popup. Press "Cancel".
5. Right click on cp-clip in the Applications folder and press "Open".
6. The popup from before will change. Now you can press "Open".
8. cp-clip requires Accessibility enabled to properly paste for you. Visit your system Preferences.
9. Go to "Security & Privacy" > "Privacy" tab and find "Accessibility".
10. Click a padlock icon in bottom left to be able to make any changes in this window.
11. On the right side list find cp-clip and make sure the checkbox is checked. If you cannot find cp-clip on the list,
    press + icon and add it manually.
12. (optional) If you want to use Color Picker functionality (`Control/Command` + `Alt` + `C`) you also need to set "
    Screen recording" permissions. cp-clip takes a screenshot to determine the color of pixel where your cursor is. If
    this permission isn't set Color Picker will return a random color.

### Notes

After each update you need to re-do everything.

Permissions set in step 10 and 11 will persist but you might need to remove and re-add them to make them work.

That is required because cp-clip is an unsigned application. Signing the application requires an Apple Developer account
which costs 99$ every year and cp-clip is a non-profit application.
